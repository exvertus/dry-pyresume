# DRY PyResume

Json/yaml (with overlay-patching) -> html/pdf resume formatter.

Uses the [JSON-6902 patching standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902) to define
multiple resume versions using structured data according to the [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
See the samples folder for examples and how define resume data.
