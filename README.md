# Resume Automator

Code enabling separation of resume *content* from resume *style/formatting*
with tools for managing and automating.

Keeping a resume up-to-date if you are constantly gaining new experience
and skills can be challenging without some DRY-enabling automation, especially
if you are formatting them manually, since prospective employees need to continually update:
- a PDF copy
- a docx copy
- personal site pages
- profiles on professional-networking platforms

Additionally, the job search can sometimes present an interesting dilemma.
Many employers expect to be treated as special and can demand custom cover letters and
essays about "why *you* want to be the next <insert quirky, potentially-nauseating
name for their employees here>". But a hiring manager with a stack of applications
to get through does not have the luxury to reciprocate this up-front special treatment.
The apparent double-standard is not nefarious as much as to make the job of their 
hiring staff easier---if you had a massive pile of applications on your desk, 
you would ask the needles in the haystack to raise their hands too.

So while it is advantageous for a candidite to custom-tailor their application-documents
*for that employer*, this can be taken to [extreme lengths](https://www.newsweek.com/woman-draws-pixar-characters-outside-studio-gets-attention-employees-1674117)
and can feel like an eggs-in-one-basket problem pretty quickly. Therefore, there is a need
for candidates to strike a balance between standing out to a particular employer while
still diverisfying. So this also includes a [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)-like way 
of using overlays to specialize each resume and cover-letter to add things like custom-
summaries, re-ordering most relevant skills to the top, etc.
